Before start with coding lets understand few imp concepts for DP
1) Parent of dp is recursion all questions of dp ca be solve using recursion 
2) Most imp point is to how to identify if the question is from dp or not 
   a) First identify if it is recursion problem or not 
   b)So in  dp / recursion problem there will be choice Include/exclude or select/not select or pick/drop 
   c) Optimal things are ask  Maximum/ minimum or largest /smallest 
   d)  Overlapping subproblem or not (this is specific to dp and not recursion )
        So if our recursive solution includes at least 2 calls to itself then it will be DP problem
        That is because there is huge chance that the subproblem of one call has been solved in another subproblem 

3) Steps to solve dp problem 
    1) write recursive Problem
    2) write memorization 
    3) top-down approach (table) 
4) DP is the topic with most parent problems 

        0-1 Knapsack 

        Unbounded Knapsack 

        Fibonacci Series 

        LCS (Hard and imp )

        LIS (Hard and imp )

        Kadaneâ€™s algo (Hard and imp )

        Matrix Chain Multiplication (Hard and imp )

        DP on trees (Hard and imp )

        DP on grid 

        Others         

 Once we solve all of these questions with proper understanding we are done (all subproblem too )
